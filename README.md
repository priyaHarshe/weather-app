# weather-app

This Weather App is a simple and user-friendly Python application that allows users to check the weather for any city around the world. It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the current temperature, weather description, and weather icon. The app also provides information about the PM Accelerator program.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Get the current weather for any city worldwide.
- **Weather Information**: Displays temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the weather condition.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive GUI built using Tkinter and ttkbootstrap.
- **PM Accelerator Info**: Includes a feature to display information about the Product Manager Accelerator program.
- **Personalized**: Displays the developer's name on the interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used for the application.
- **Tkinter**: Pythonâ€™s standard GUI library used to build the graphical user interface.
- **ttkbootstrap**: A modern styling library for Tkinter, used to create a more visually appealing interface.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Python Imaging Library used to handle the weather icon images.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: External API used to fetch the weather data.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install requests
pip install tkinter
pip install pillow
